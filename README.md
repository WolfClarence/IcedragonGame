This is a game platform I developed with my teammates when I was in NPU in China. So many comments are in Chinese.
The basic logic: users can get points by posting games or login or comment. Then they can use the points to download the game links that other users post.
All of games are in the form of download links which is popular in China, especially some cloud disk apps.
People can post game links, describe their game and encourage others to pay points for it, and comments to others' game links, say whatever they want to say.
People with a lot of points, whatever whether used, will be given different titles to praise their honor.
